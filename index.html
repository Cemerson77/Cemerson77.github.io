        <p>Welcome to my CS-499 Capstone portfolio! I am deeply passionate about Computer Science, and I am thrilled to present the culmination of my efforts in the form of the Android app, "FitTrack." This project has undergone significant enhancements during the CS-499 Capstone class at Southern New Hampshire University, with a dedicated focus on refining aspects such as software design and engineering, implementing advanced algorithms and data structures, and optimizing database functionality. I invite you to explore the evolution of "FitTrack" through this showcase, highlighting the application of key principles and skills acquired throughout my academic journey.</p>

        <h3>Code Review</h3>
        <p>Code review is a foundational practice in the software development process. It encompasses the systematic examination and evaluation of code authored by a colleague or team member. There must be at least one person who did not write the code. The primary aim is to ensure the quality, reliability, and security of the code before it becomes an integral part of the project. This multifaceted process includes compliance with coding standards, functional assessments, identification of potential security vulnerabilities, and bug detection.</p>
