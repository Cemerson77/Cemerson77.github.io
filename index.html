      <h3>Code Review</h3>
      <p>	Code review is a foundational practice in the software development process. It encompasses the systematic examination and evaluation of code authored by a colleague or team member. There must be at least one person who did not write the code. The primary aim is to ensure the quality, reliability, and security of the code before it becomes an integral part of the project. This multifaceted process includes compliance with coding standards, functional assessments, identification of potential security vulnerabilities, and bug detection.</p>
