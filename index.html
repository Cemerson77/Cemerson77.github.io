	<p><b>What I Learned:</b></p>
	<p>&emsp;Enhancing and modifying the FitTrack SQLite Database provided valuable insights into various database management and software development aspects. Here's a deeper exploration of the key learnings:</p>
	<p><b>1.	Optimizing Query Performance through Indexing:</b></p>
	<p><b>&emsp;•	Lesson: </b>The strategic creation of indexes is pivotal for optimizing query performance.</p>
	<p><b>&emsp;•	Insight: </b>I learned that introducing an index on the COLUMN_DATE in the WeightEntryDatabaseHelper class could significantly enhance the efficiency of date-based queries. This experience underscored the importance of understanding the specific data access patterns to make informed decisions on where to implement indexes.</p>
	<p><b>2.	Validation for Code Robustness:</b></p>
	<p><b>&emsp;•	Lesson: </b>Explicit validation of column indices is crucial for code robustness.</p>
	<p><b>&emsp;•	Insight: </b>While working on cursor handling in the same class, I realized the potential risks associated with assuming the validity of column indices. By incorporating checks for valid indices, I enhanced the code's robustness and gained a deeper appreciation for defensive programming practices. This experience emphasized the importance of anticipating and addressing potential issues proactively.</p>
	<p><b>3.	Effective Resource Management with try-with-resources:</b></p>
	<p><b>&emsp;•	Lesson: </b>Utilizing try-with-resources improves resource management.</p>
	<p><b>&emsp;•	Insight: </b>Introducing try-with-resources in various sections, particularly in the Cursor Closing enhancement, taught me about the cleaner and safer handling of resources. This practice contributes to more readable and concise code and ensures that resources like cursors are appropriately closed, reducing the risk of memory leaks. It reinforced the significance of adopting modern language features to enhance code quality and reliability.</p>
	<p><b>4.	Iterative Refinement through Instructor Dialogues:</b></p>
	<p><b>&emsp;•	Lesson: </b>Iterative discussions with the instructor refine enhancement plans.</p>
	<p><b>&emsp;•	Insight: </b>As initiated in Module One, engaging in an ongoing dialogue with the instructor played a pivotal role in overcoming challenges and refining the enhancement plan. This iterative process improved the quality of the enhancements and highlighted the collaborative nature of software development. It underscored the importance of seeking feedback and continuously refining solutions for optimal outcomes.</p>
	<p><b>5.	Balancing Optimization with Existing Functionality:</b></p>
	<p><b>&emsp;•	Lesson: </b>Balancing enhancements with existing functionality requires careful consideration.</p>
	<p><b>&emsp;•	Insight: </b>As I worked on refining the artifact, I encountered the challenge of ensuring that the introduced enhancements seamlessly integrated with the existing codebase. This process demanded a delicate balance between optimization and preserving the app's core functionality. It taught me the importance of thorough testing and validation to ensure that improvements do not inadvertently introduce new issues.</p>
