        <h3>Code Review</h3>
        <p>Code review is a foundational practice in the software development process. It encompasses the systematic examination and evaluation of code authored by a colleague or team member. There must be at least one person who did not write the code. The primary aim is to ensure the quality, reliability, and security of the code before it becomes an integral part of the project. This multifaceted process includes compliance with coding standards, functional assessments, identification of potential security vulnerabilities, and bug detection.</p>

        <h3>Software Design and Engineering</h3>
        <p>  FitTrack emerged as a comprehensive Android weight-tracking application coded in Java and XML in Android Studio, meticulously developed during the CS 360 Mobile Architect & Programming course, which concluded last term. Its inception was fueled by offering users a seamless platform to track their weight, set goals, and monitor their fitness journey.</p>
        <p>  The selection of FitTrack for my ePortfolio is rooted in its embodiment of diverse software development skills. It serves as a canvas illustrating my proficiency in various vital areas. Integrating bcrypt for password hashing reflects a commitment to security, ensuring user data is safeguarded against potential threats. Password strength validation, a feature that was not initially present, was introduced to enhance the application's robustness, encouraging users to adopt strong and secure passwords. Furthermore, the transition from hard-coded strings to string resources represents a step toward improved internationalization and easier maintenance. The crown jewel, however, is incorporating a settings page with a dark mode feature, enriching the user experience and aligning the app with modern design trends.</p>
        <p>  The enhancements made to FitTrack flawlessly align with the outlined course objectives. The meticulous attention to software design principles is evident in the revamped UI, offering a more consistent and engaging user experience. Proficiency in user experience design is showcased through the introduction of the settings page, providing users with customization options like dark mode. These enhancements, coupled with incorporating bcrypt and other security measures, exemplify the strategic use of innovative techniques and tools in computing practices. No updates to outcome-coverage plans are necessary, as the enhancements seamlessly achieved the objectives outlined in Module One.</p>
        <p>  The journey of enhancing FitTrack was a profound learning experience. Delving into UI/UX design and user-centered principles, I acquired a deeper understanding of creating interfaces that meet functional requirements and elevate the overall user experience. The introduction of bcrypt for password hashing challenged ensuring a balance between security and performance. Overcoming this challenge required careful consideration and thorough testing to guarantee the app's integrity and user satisfaction. Additionally, aligning the UI design across the app demanded meticulous attention to detail, emphasizing the importance of consistency in user interfaces.</p>
        <p>  For reference, the enhancements I created are as follows:</p>
        <p>     1.	Security Enhancement: Integrating the bcrypt password hashing algorithm in the SignUpActivity ensures a robust security layer. The application mitigates potential risks associated with unauthorized access by securely storing user passwords in the database. This enhancement reflects a commitment to safeguarding user accounts and sensitive information.</p>
        <p>     2.	String Resources: Although the transition from hard-coded strings to string resources is still in progress, considering the size of the application, this initiative in SignUpActivity demonstrates a dedication to best practices in Android development. The ongoing effort to centralize and manage string resources will contribute to easier localization and maintenance of the application.</p>
        <p>     3.	Password Strength Validation: The SignUpActivity now features password strength validation, setting criteria for a secure password, including considerations for length and a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters. This proactive measure aims to enhance the overall security posture of user accounts.</p>
        <p>     4.	Enhanced Comments: All Java class code comments have been refined for improved clarity and maintainability, including header comments in the Java classes. The enhanced comments serve as valuable documentation, aiding in understanding the logic behind each code segment and facilitating collaboration with other developers who may work on the project in the future.</p>
        <p>     5.	SettingsActivity for Dark Mode: A SettingsActivity has been introduced to empower users to switch the app to dark mode. This user-centric feature enhances the overall user experience by providing customization options that align with modern design trends and user expectations.</p>
        <p>  A meticulous approach was adopted to address the challenges encountered during the enhancement process of FitTrack, particularly in integrating bcrypt for password hashing. One key challenge was finding the right balance between security and performance. Bcrypt, chosen for its slow and computationally intensive nature, posed potential performance concerns. To address this, extensive testing was conducted to fine-tune the configuration parameters of bcrypt, ensuring that the application maintained a high level of security while also meeting performance expectations. </p>
	<p>  The introduction of password strength validation in SignUpActivity presented another challenge, requiring careful consideration of the criteria for a secure password. It involved setting specific password length requirements and combining upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters. The challenge here was to balance creating stringent criteria for enhanced security and maintaining user-friendliness. The iterative refinement of these criteria and continuous testing allowed for the developing of a robust yet user-friendly password strength validation system.</p>
	<p>  Furthermore, aligning the UI design across the app demanded meticulous attention to detail. Achieving a consistent and engaging user interface required refining the layout, color schemes, and design elements. The challenge was to ensure that the transition to a modern and cohesive design did not compromise the application's usability. This process involved iterative testing and feedback gathering to make informed design decisions that resonated with the user base.</p>
	<p>  Expanding on the learning aspects, adopting bcrypt brought a deeper understanding of password security in software development. Bcrypt, with its adaptive nature and salting mechanism, demonstrated a sophisticated approach to thwarting common attacks, especially brute-force attempts. The concept of salting, where unique salts are automatically generated for each password, significantly enhances security by ensuring that even identical passwords result in different hash representations. This nuanced understanding of security measures emphasizes the importance of a multi-layered security strategy, where hashing strength, salting, and other factors collectively contribute to robust protection against potential threats.</p>
	<p>  The password strength validation feature contributed to a broader understanding of user-centric security considerations. Striking the right balance between stringent password requirements and user-friendliness is crucial. It involves educating users on the importance of strong passwords while providing a positive user experience. This aspect of security design emphasizes the need for proactive measures to fortify user accounts and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.</p>
	<p>  In conclusion, the challenges faced and addressed in the enhancement process of FitTrack provided valuable insights into the intricacies of security implementation and user-centric design considerations. The adoption of bcrypt and the introduction of password strength validation exemplify a commitment to delivering a secure and user-friendly application, contributing to a more comprehensive skill set in software development.</p>
