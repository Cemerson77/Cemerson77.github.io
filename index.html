	<p>Artifact Impact: Integrating bcrypt for password hashing and introducing password strength validation contribute to developing a security mindset, ensuring the safeguarding of user accounts and sensitive information.</p>
			
	<p><b>Reflection of Enhancements</b></p>
	<p>  &emsp;The journey of enhancing FitTrack was a profound learning experience. Delving into UI/UX design and user-centered principles, I acquired a deeper understanding of creating interfaces that meet functional requirements and elevate the overall user experience. The introduction of bcrypt for password hashing challenged ensuring a balance between security and performance. Overcoming this challenge required careful consideration and thorough testing to guarantee the app's integrity and user satisfaction. Additionally, aligning the UI design across the app demanded meticulous attention to detail, emphasizing the importance of consistency in user interfaces.</p>
        <p>  For reference, the enhancements I created are as follows:</p>
        <p>   &emsp; <b> 1.	Security Enhancement:</b> Integrating the bcrypt password hashing algorithm in the SignUpActivity ensures a robust security layer. The application mitigates potential risks associated with unauthorized access by securely storing user passwords in the database. This enhancement reflects a commitment to safeguarding user accounts and sensitive information.</p>
        <p>   &emsp; <b> 2.	String Resources:</b> The transition from hard-coded strings to string resources in SignUpActivity demonstrates a dedication to best practices in Android development. Centralizing and managing string resources contributes to easier localization and maintenance of the application.</p>
        <p>   &emsp; <b> 3.	Password Strength Validation:</b> The SignUpActivity now features password strength validation, setting criteria for a secure password, including considerations for length and a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters. This proactive measure aims to enhance the overall security posture of user accounts.</p>
        <p>   &emsp; <b> 4.	Enhanced Comments:</b> All Java class code comments have been refined for improved clarity and maintainability, including header comments in the Java classes. The enhanced comments serve as valuable documentation, aiding in understanding the logic behind each code segment and facilitating collaboration with other developers who may work on the project in the future.</p>
        <p>   &emsp; <b> 5.	Settings Activity for Dark Mode:</b> A SettingsActivity has been introduced to empower users to switch the app to dark mode. This user-centric feature enhances the overall user experience by providing customization options that align with modern design trends and user expectations.</p>
        <p><b>Addressing Challenges and Learning</b></p>
	<p>  &emsp;A meticulous approach was adopted to address the challenges encountered during the enhancement process of FitTrack, particularly in integrating bcrypt for password hashing. One key challenge was finding the right balance between security and performance. Bcrypt, chosen for its slow and computationally intensive nature, posed potential performance concerns. To address this, extensive testing was conducted to fine-tune the configuration parameters of bcrypt, ensuring that the application maintained a high level of security while also meeting performance expectations. </p>
	<p>  &emsp;The introduction of password strength validation in SignUpActivity presented another challenge, requiring careful consideration of the criteria for a secure password. It involved setting specific password length requirements and combining upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters. The challenge here was to balance creating stringent criteria for enhanced security and maintaining user-friendliness. The iterative refinement of these criteria and continuous testing allowed for the developing of a robust yet user-friendly password strength validation system.</p>
	<p>  &emsp;Furthermore, aligning the UI design across the app demanded meticulous attention to detail. Achieving a consistent and engaging user interface required refining the layout, color schemes, and design elements. The challenge was to ensure that the transition to a modern and cohesive design did not compromise the application's usability. This process involved iterative testing and feedback gathering to make informed design decisions that resonated with the user base.</p>
